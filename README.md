# NYC film permits

Numerous motion picture, music, television and streaming production activities take place in New York City every year. 

Permits are generally required for exclusive use of city properties, e.g. sidewalks, streets or parks. The [Film Office](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/mome/permits/permits.page), a division of the [Mayor's Office of Media and Entertainment (MOME)](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/mome/index.page), issues permits for production activities in the NYC boroughs.

This exploratory data analysis relies on data provided by MOME to answer the following questions for the 2012-2021 period:

- What were the preferred boroughs for filming activities? Did this scenario change over time?

- What were the most common production categories? Did this scenario change over time?

- What were the prevalent production categories in each borough?

- Were productions mostly domestic or foreign?

- What was the preferred month for filming activities? What was the least favourite month?

- What was the preferred day of the week for filming activities? What was the least favourite day of the week?

The analysis was conducted with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). [Plotly Express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/) was employed to create interactive charts.
